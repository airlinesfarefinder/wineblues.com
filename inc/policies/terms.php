                    <p><strong>wineblues.com is not a travel provider and does not sell travel-related services directly.</strong></p>

                    <p>wineblues.com offers tools and resources to help you search, compare, and plan travel options. Our platform includes online search tools and any associated software or systems designed to facilitate your travel planning.</p>

                    <p>The wineblues.com Service is an online travel search platform. We do not own, control, or provide any of the travel services or products displayed through our Service—such as bus tickets, train tickets, flights, rental cars, hotels, or other travel offerings (“Travel Offerings”). Those Travel Offerings are provided and managed entirely by third-party travel providers (“Travel Providers”), whether directly or via agents such as online travel agencies.</p>

                    <p>Travel Providers are solely responsible for their Travel Offerings and their own terms and conditions, including privacy and refund policies. You agree to review and accept each Travel Provider’s terms before booking. Any interaction with Travel Providers via wineblues.com is at your own risk, and wineblues.com is not liable if any issues arise with your reservation, during travel, or afterward.</p>

                    <p>The appearance of any Travel Offering or Travel Provider on wineblues.com does not imply endorsement, recommendation, sponsorship, control, or affiliation with wineblues.com.</p>

                    <h2><span class="section-number">Section 2</span> — Data Accuracy &amp; Pricing</h2>
                    <p>wineblues.com displays data—such as pricing, availability, locations, and schedules—sourced from Travel Providers. We do not warrant, guarantee, or take responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, or completeness of such data. wineblues.com does not provide or service any Travel Offerings, nor do we verify information supplied by Travel Providers.</p>

                    <p>Prices and availability shown on wineblues.com can change at any time. Additional fees, taxes, or surcharges may apply. Some listings may appear in a currency different from your default or selected display currency.</p>

                    <p>Currency conversions provided on wineblues.com are for informational purposes only. Actual exchange rates and any associated fees are determined by your payment provider.</p>

                    <p>wineblues.com may charge a service fee for transactions completed on our platform. These fees help cover our platform costs and support ongoing improvements to our Service.</p>

                    <p>Service fees vary by transaction and will be clearly displayed during the booking process. <strong>All service fees are non-refundable</strong> once a reservation is confirmed, as they are charged for the use of our platform and services.</p>

                    <h2><span class="section-number">Section 4</span> — Reservations &amp; Travel Provider Relationships</h2>
                    <p>When you make a reservation through the wineblues.com Service, you are booking directly with the Travel Provider shown at the final booking step. We simply facilitate the reservation by providing a user interface to interact with the Travel Provider’s booking system.</p>

                    <p>wineblues.com is not responsible for any aspect of your reservation or the Travel Offering itself—this includes descriptions, pricing, fees, availability, or any travel disruptions. Those are governed solely by the Travel Provider’s policies.</p>

                    <p>If any issues or disputes arise regarding your reservation, you agree to resolve them directly with the Travel Provider, not with wineblues.com. In certain cases,wineblues.com may collect payment on behalf of the Travel Provider. Nonetheless, your reservation remains with the Travel Provider at all times, and any refunds are subject to the Travel Provider’s refund policy—handled by wineblues.com only when explicitly authorized in writing by the Travel Provider.</p>

                    <p>Tickets and reservations are non-transferable. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed only under the Travel Provider’s policies and procedures.</p>
